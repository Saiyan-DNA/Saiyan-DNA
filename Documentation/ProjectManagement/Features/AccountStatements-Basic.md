# Account Statements - Basic

### Status
In Development

### GitHub Milestone
[5: Account Statements - Basic](https://github.com/Saiyan-DNA/HomeCentral/milestone/5)


## Summary

Users require the ability to view, edit, and delete statements for their accounts. This includes account statements for financial accounts (banking, credit cards, loans ,etc.) as well as billing statements from providers (utilities, medical, etc.). 

## Expected Functionality

The Account Overview screen should be extended to provide a list of transactions (currently available) on one tab and Account Statements listed on another tab.
- Statements should be listed in descending order by statement date.
  - List should display the period start and end dates
  - List should display the Opening and Closing balances
- Selecting a statement should navigate the user to a detail view.

A new view should be created for "Bills", which provides an overview of bills (statements not linked to checking or savings accounts) with sections for each category (credit cards, loans, utilities, medical, etc.) and status (Past Due, Due Now, Upcoming)
